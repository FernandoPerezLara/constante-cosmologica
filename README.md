# ðŸŒŒ Cosmological constant

The main purpose of this project is to find where the cosmological constant comes from.

This program aims to show you that the cosmological constant comes from other universal constants by mixing all kinds of combinations between them.

The condition is that the combination of these constants must form the same units of the cosmological constant.
